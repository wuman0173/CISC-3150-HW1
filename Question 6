//Comments
//took me a while to figure out how to make the circles be determined..
//If the 2 radii are equal to the distance between centers, they are touching... TRUE?
//if the 2 radii is less than the distance between centers, they are not touching...
//Now how do overlap and within each other... WORKING!
